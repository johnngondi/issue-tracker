# Issue Tracker App

## Introduction
This app will help the **Verus Africa** and **NW Realite LTD IT Department** 
track all issues with software systems utilized by NW Realite LTD in their day to day operations or 
any other software system developed by Verus Africa.

It will also expose a very simple API to enable seamless integration with these software systems.

## Ecosystem
Out of the box it provides two plugins for integration with other software systems.
They will help logged in users submit issues & view the submitted issues status
right from the app interface i.e. from any page.

**1. JQuery plugin** - This will integrate with JQuery apps. Get it <a href=''>here</a>

**2. VueJS plugin** - This will integrate with VueJS apps. Get it <a href=''>here</a>
